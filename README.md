# Chinese Chess built in Java

A two player Chinese Chess Game implemented in JAVA using the swing libraries for COP 3252.

Beyond implementing the rules of standard Chinese Chess, this game includes bonus features such as move timers, theming, exporting move history, a live event log, and a fully fledged gui.

To run the game, simply download the jar file, and use the command java -jar hwx.jar.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi#Rules>How to Play</a>

1. Download the jar file from <a href=https://github.com/itsandyjiang/Chinese-Chess-Xiangqi>here</a>
2. On a machine with at least Java 8, run the following command: "java -jar hwx.jar"
3. Configure your theme on the start menu, or just press the begin button to launch the board.
4. Select a piece to highlight it
5. Select an endpoint to attempt to move the piece there   (*note that the bottom player always goes first*)
6. The game will automatically inform you if a checkmate or stalemate has been reached by standard rules.
7. If you wish to end the game early, click on the End Game button.
8. To play again, exit the game and repeast steps 2 through 7.

## Roles
Michael handled most of the GUI stuff in game, Venkat handled most of the game logic stuff, and Andy handled most of the bonus feature stuff. We mostly focused on our individual parts but communicated a lot to make sure everything would be easily compatible. 

##### Andy Jiang
* Implemented move timers and move logger along with the player system
* Created the GUI for the timers and asynchronous updating, with animation.
* Implemented game saving

##### Michael Yu:
* Created the visual game board and its event handling
* Managed language settings and the images of each piece
* Created the event/chat box and the end screen

##### Venkat Pamulapati
* Implemented the game logic including the board, the checking/validation, pieces, edge case handling, etc.
* Created the Start Menu
* Implemented theming

## In-depth feature overview:

### *Game Logic*

#### Move checking
The game is essentially handled by manipulating a two-dimensional array of Point objects. Each point object holds a piece, which are differnciated
by their move patterns. In order to make a move, the player creates a move object (input through the gui) which is then subject to a series of check
which can be categorized into two categories pre-move checking and post-move checking.

Shallow checking concerns only the piece and the move, and ignores the rest of the board. For example, if I want to move a horse all I need to 
do is check that the given move object has a valid move pattern (ex: 2 up 1 right) and see if it has any pieces in the way. We can actually see this without
moving the piece at all, since we know exactly where the piece is going. The problem with shallow checking
is that it doesn't account for factors such as:

 * Does moving this piece put our general in check?
 * Does this moving this piece make the generals face each other?
 
Deep checking solves these problems. The way post move checking works is that it executes the move privately and then 
proceeds to run tests to see if the move is legal. If it fails, it simply undoes the move privately. You may wonder, why 
not just use deep checking for everything then? Besides saving resources
(looking for a checkmate is O(n^3) currently) there are several cases where it is needed. For example, in order to see if there's a checkmate, we need to see what pieces are delivering a check. A piece can deliver a check, even if the move to actually attak the general is illegal! (For example, if moving the piece that is delivering the check would cause it's own general to 
fall into check.)

Once a move has been thoroughly checked, it is then executed on the array.

#### Edge Case handling
Beyond move validation, there is also checking for when the board has reached checkmate or stalemate. Once these cases have 
been reached neither player can move. Some stalemate edge cases include when the board has no pieces that can cross the river or when 
the only pieces remaining are the generals and a single cannon.

The board is designed to be easily accessed by the other packages of the game with minimal knowledge of how it functions.

### *GUI*

#### Start menu
Instead of having command line arguments, the start up menu allows users to easily set their preferences. It includes 
a decent user interface for setting up player names and the current theme with a live preview of what the board will look like
if they use the english verison. The themeing is applied throughout the game board, even in subtle areas like the timer. The theming 
very extensible because it carries the data in a Profile object which is stored as core member data. This way, any part of the application 
can easily access what it needs.

#### Board Frame
The BoardFrame displays the BoardPanel, the BoardMenu, the ChatBox, and the TimerPanel. It is the main JFrame of the game and organizes
the layout of every component of the board. It also manages the event handling for the JPopupMenu, which will display a 
save button when the user right clicks on the board.

#### Board Panel
The BoardPanel class displays the main chinese chess game board and handles the event handling that occurs in the game.
It holds a reference to the board from the core class and updates the appearance of the board if a change is made by the user. 
It also resizes with the window without issue.

It also contains an inner class called "Icons" that defines the JLabel that exists on every point of the board. Each Icon will display its corresponding piece,
if it has one, and changes the appearance of it depending on the language setting of the menu. Depending on the language, the color
of the piece, and the type of the piece, an image will be retrieved from the Pictures folder and displayed on the piece. It implements the
MouseListener that will store the chosen piece and its chosen destination and send the potential move to the core class, where it
will be evaluated to see if the move is legal.

#### Board Menu
The BoardMenu creates the JMenuBar displayed on the BoardFrame. It contains the options to change the language (the
appearance of the pieces), to save or exit the game, and to learn the rules of the game through a link to the Wikipedia page of 
Chinese Chess.

#### Chat Box
The ChatBox creates the chat box on the bottom right of the BoardFrame that displays any messages that the system outputs.
It redirects the output originally sent to System.out to the JTextArea that will display the messages on the GUI. This is done
by reassigning the standard output stream to a new one, designed to write each character sent to System.out to the designated 
ChatBox. The ChatBox contains a title on the top of the panel and an end game button on the bottom of the panel.

#### EndScreen
The EndScreen is the final window that will appear in this GUI. It appears when the game has reached a checkmate, a stalemate, or if
the user presses the end game button on the very bottom right of the window. It displays the end result of the game as well as
two buttons to either restart the game or exit the game.

#### Timer and Timer GUI:
The Timer class keeps track of the start and stop time in nanoseconds (System.nanoTime()) to determine the time elapsed, which 
is then converted into milliseconds. Nanoseconds was used over milliseconds for a more precise measurement of time elapsed. It is then implemented
into the Player class to create a timer for each individual player. All methods of timer is called through the Player class.
The Player class interacts with the Timer class to get all necessary information about the player's time elapsed during each turn.
Then, it formats it in mm:ss format using SimpleDateFormat and make it accessible for the TurnTimerPanel to get.

The TurnTimerPanel is a GridLayout (2x1) of two timer panel (one for each player). Inside each timer panel, there is a
number panel, centered inside timer panel using BorderLayout, which includes the time label. The time label is inside
a panel to create extra space between the number and border.

In order for the two timer panel to update the time left for each player, threading must be used. Without threads, when
updating the label inside a while loop, the game does not function until while loop is exited. Thus, the time labels
must be updated asynchronously with the game. Players' timer is stopped when their turn is over and started again when
their turn start. Thus, the updating of each label is started and stopped, to create a animation of switching. However,
dead threads can not be restarted, thus a new thread is created each time the label is suppose to update.

The timer also acts as current player indicator by fading or highlighting it's colors which are set by the current theme.
